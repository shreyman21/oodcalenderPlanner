Overview:
The Event Planner Application is designed to manage and automate the scheduling of events for
users. The purpose is to create a schedule that avoids overlapping events by creating an easier
way to create, modify, remove, and view events. Some background knowledge needed are basic
knowledge of event planning and common scheduling terms such as start and end time. The
extensibility envisioned focuses on adding more complex scheduling features in the future but it
currently focuses on basic event management and schedule automation.


Quick Start:
To get started with the Event Planner Application, you first need to create a User and an Event.
An example is shown below:
User user = new User("1", "John Doe");
Event event = new Event("Meeting", LocalDateTime.now(), LocalDateTime.now().plusHours(1),
                        "Conference Room", false, new ArrayList<>(), new ArrayList<>());
user.getSchedule().addEvent(event);

This snippet demonstrates how to create a user, create an event, and add the event to the user's
schedule.


Key Components and Subcomponents:
- plannerSystem
  The plannerSystem is the main component for managing users and their events. It provides the
  core functions for scheduling events, including uploading schedules from XML files, saving
  schedules, and performing other main functions like creating, modifying, removing, and
  auto-scheduling events. It interfaces with all other components to ensure smooth operation of
  the application.

- Event:
This component represents a scheduled event, with details such as event name, start and end times,
location, and whether it's online or in-person.

- User:
This component is for user details and their schedule. Each user has a unique ID and a name,
along with a Schedule object that holds their events.

- Schedule:
This component is a collection of Event objects. It provides methods to add, remove,
and list events.

- Utils:
This component has the utility methods for reading from and writing to XML files, and other
utility operations that support the main functionalities of the application.

- textualView:
This component is used to display the schedules of each user in a readable format. It formats the
event details and schedules into the appropriate output. It the provides the name, time, location,
online status, and invitees, making it easier for users to understand their schedules at a glance.


Source Organization:
The codebase is organized into the model package:
/model/User.java: Defines the User class with user details and schedule.
/model/Event.java: Represents individual events.
/model/Schedule.java: Manages a collection of events for a user.
/model/plannerSystem.java: Core system for managing users and their events.
/model/plannerSystemModel.java: Interface defining the operations supported by the planner system.

There is also the view package which contains the textualView:
/view/textualView.java: Implements the plannerView interface to display users' schedules in a text
format. It formats and prints schedule and event details to the console in a specific format.

The test package contains the tests for the other packages:
/test/model/: Contains unit tests for classes within the model package, ensuring that the
logic and data models behave as expected as well as tests for edge cases.

/test/view/: Contains tests for the textualView class, verifying that the presentation
layer correctly formats and displays data.
